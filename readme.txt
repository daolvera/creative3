This is a creative project, so you are welcome to build what you would like. It should not be too similar to the website you built for Lab 3a or 3b. You must create your own original work.  The basic requirements are:

The site uses Vue and the Vue CLI
The site has at least three pages
The site has some mock data that is at least as detailed as the mock data used in the prior lab.
The site contains a footer that links to your public GitHub repository
The GitHub repository should be in your own GitHub account and should be a public repository.

If you are building off a an old creative project it should have new functionality or new pages.
